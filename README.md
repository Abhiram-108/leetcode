# Daily LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I solve daily LeetCode problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills and improve my coding proficiency. Each day, I tackle a new problem, and my solutions are stored here for reference and improvement.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by month and day. Each problem has its own directory, containing:
- `problem.md`: A brief description of the problem.
- `solution.py`: My solution to the problem in Python.
- `notes.md`: Any additional notes, alternative solutions, or explanations.

Example structure:
├── July
│ ├── 01
│ │ ├── problem.md
│ │ ├── solution.py
│ │ └── notes.md
│ ├── 02
│ │ ├── problem.md
│ │ ├── solution.py
│ │ └── notes.md
│ └── ...
└── ...

## Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement thoroughly.
2. **Plan the Solution**: Outline the approach and choose the most suitable data structures and algorithms.
3. **Write the Code**: Implement the solution in Python.
4. **Test the Solution**: Run test cases to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the solution.
5. **Optimize (if necessary)**: Refine the solution for better performance and readability.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the problems and solutions. Each `problem.md` file contains the problem statement and sometimes additional links for reference. The `solution.py` files are my implementations, and the `notes.md` files may contain explanations, alternative approaches, or improvements.
